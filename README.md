# Declarative concurrency with ZIO STM

Slides from my talk originally presented at [Scala User Group - Berlin Brandenburg][1].

## Abstract

Software transactional memory (STM) is an abstraction analogous to database
transactions used to build safe, composable and modular code dealing with
concurrency.

In this talk, Dejan will present the building blocks of STM implementation
available in ZIO library. He'll demonstrate how to use the STM and its
accompanying structures (e.g. TRef, TQueue etc.) and discuss their internal
implementation details.

## Biography

Dejan Mijic works as a senior software engineer at Zalando SE in Berlin, Germany.
He is passionate about functional programming and distributed systems. Outside
of his daily job, he enjoys contributing to OSS projects and competing in general
knowledge quizzes.
