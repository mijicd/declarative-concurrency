# Declarative concurrency with ZIO STM

## Abstract

Software transactional memory (STM) is an abstraction analogous to database
transactions used to build safe, composable, and modular code dealing with
concurrency.

Attendees of this workshop will learn how to use STM and its accompanying data
structures (e.g., TMap and TQueue) by solving some of the well-known concurrency
challenges. In addition to that, we'll dive into the library implementation details,
and discuss the impact of STM on program semantics and performance.
